# C++-database-simulation
This repository contains a coursework project from the IN2029 Programming in C++ module. The project simulates a simple database operation, demonstrating proficiency in:
   File I/O operations.
   Object-oriented programming principles.
   Use of standard containers (e.g., vectors, maps).
   
Features:
Reads data from two files: payments.txt and people.txt.
Processes the data to generate a statement for each person, listing their purchases and total payments.
Validates the structure of input files and handles errors gracefully with descriptive messages.

Input Files
payments.txt: Contains records of purchases, including the name of the person, the object purchased, and the price.
people.txt: Lists names of people for whom statements will be generated.
